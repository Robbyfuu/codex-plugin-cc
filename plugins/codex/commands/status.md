!`node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/codex-companion.mjs" status "$ARGUMENTS"`

If the user did not pass a job ID:
- Render the command output as a single Markdown table for the current and past runs in this session.
- Keep it compact. Do not include progress blocks or extra prose outside the table.
- Preserve the actionable fields from the command output, including job ID, kind, status, phase, elapsed or duration, summary, and follow-up commands.

If the user did pass a job ID:
- Present the full command output to the user.
- Do not summarize or condense it.

For active (queued or running) jobs, the output includes a `Live log:` line with the absolute path to the per-job event log, plus a `Tail:` hint (`tail -F <path>`) and a `Watch pane:` hint (`/peer:watch <job-id>`). Preserve these so the user can follow the turn live as it happens instead of waiting for it to finish.
